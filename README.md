# Interpretable Machine Learning for Customer Churn Prediction using SHAP

This project develops a **high-performance and explainable machine learning model** to predict **customer churn** and understand **why customers are likely to leave**.

---

## Project Objective

To build an **interpretable churn prediction system** that:

- Accurately predicts whether a customer will churn  
- Identifies key factors driving churn  
- Explains individual predictions  
- Supports data-driven retention strategies
