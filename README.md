 #Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
 SHAP Analysis for Customer Churn Prediction
Using XGBoost + SHAP on the Customer Churn Dataset
This project builds and interprets a customer churn prediction model using
the Credit Risk and Financial Risk.csv dataset.
The model is trained with XGBoost inside a complete scikit-learn Pipeline
and interpreted using SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to produce
both global and local explanations.
